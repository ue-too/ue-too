# Simple Bezier Curve Library

This is more of like a practice. I am rewriting essentially the same thing as [bezier-js](https://github.com/Pomax/bezierjs/tree/master) by following the [Superb Guide on Bezier Curve by Pomax](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/), with my own interpetation and I/O. This is to be used on one of my future projects invloving a simulation of rail system and I plan on doing it with bezier curves. This is also the first time that I am incorporating TDD into my development flow. I am trying to start small and take baby steps, hopefully I can apply TDD on something that has a greater scope than this project does.
This project is still early on I only implemented some of the features, but feel free to take a look at it. I plan to release the package on npm as well.
